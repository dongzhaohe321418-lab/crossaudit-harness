"""Application-facing environment diagnostics and narrowly scoped repairs.

The CLI doctor is intentionally terminal-oriented.  This module exposes the
same preflight concerns as structured, non-secret data so the native app can
explain a failure before a user reaches a provider call or project creation.
Checks run off the HTTP request thread and repairs are an explicit allowlist.

    never executes — the stale one does. The app is the one place our code is

    `which` is injectable so the states can be driven; the default is a plain

    THE VERSION EVIDENCE OUTRANKS THE DIRECTORY HEURISTIC, and it has to. The

    `Path(sys.executable).resolve()`. Executed against the real failure state on
    the machine that reported it — a 3.2.0 console script in the framework `bin`
    — it returned "same" and printed no row: `.resolve()` follows a virtualenv's
    `bin/python` symlink back to the base prefix, which is the very directory
    the stale script lives in. So the heuristic reported "that is us" about the
