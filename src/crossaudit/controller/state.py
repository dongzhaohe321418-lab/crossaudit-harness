"""Controller state machine with an explicit, atomically-mutated store.

Two properties this module exists to guarantee, both of which the pre-package
implementation only approximated:

**The store's location is injected, never inferred.** The old module resolved
its state as `Path(__file__).parent / "state.json"`, which under a wheel would
put a deployment's mutable ledger inside site-packages, and under a CI job
would put it inside a throwaway checkout — where "consumed" survives nothing.
`StateStore` takes a path and keeps it.

**Every mutation is a read-modify-write inside an exclusive lock.** Admission
is a single-use claim; two concurrent verifiers must not both see an unconsumed
receipt. The lock is an `O_EXCL` file with the holder's pid and a stale-break
timeout, and the state file is replaced by atomic rename after fsync, so a
crash mid-write leaves the previous state intact rather than a truncated file.
