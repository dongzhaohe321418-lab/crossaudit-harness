"""Keeping the console alive across a closed window, and finding it again.

Closing a browser tab never stopped a build — it runs in a thread of the console
process. What stopped it was closing the terminal. So the console can now detach
from the terminal that started it, and a later `crossaudit console` finds the
running one and hands back its URL instead of starting a second server.

Three things this has to get right, and each is a small honesty problem:

* **Reattaching, not restarting.** Two consoles on one project would race on the
  working tree and the round budget. If a live daemon is found, its URL is
  returned; the second invocation starts nothing.
* **A stale run file is not a running daemon.** A crash leaves the file behind,
  so liveness is proven by asking the port, not by trusting the file.
* **An interrupted build must say so.** Git keeps every committed round but
  cannot know that a provider call was cut off mid-round. The operational
  SQLite journal records each typed run transition, so a restarted console can
  recover a dead worker exactly once instead of presenting partial work as
  finished. A legacy flag is read only to migrate projects created before the
  journal existed.

The run file holds a session token, so it is written 0600 and lives in the state
directory, which is gitignored: a credential in the ledger would be a credential
published.

    A living owner is NEVER presented as stopped — not one whose lease expired,
