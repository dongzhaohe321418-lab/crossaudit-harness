"""`crossaudit console` — two windows, one input, and the ledger between them.

The generator is the main window, the auditor the side window, and the single
input at the bottom is the black box: you type as you would to any assistant and
the router decides which side hears it. The routing decision is shown where it
happened, because a box whose sorting is invisible is asking for trust it has
not earned.

Opening a port inside a tool that holds API keys is a real attack surface, and
the defences are structural rather than promised:

* **loopback only**, bound to 127.0.0.1, and **every request — read or write —
  passes the same token-and-Host gate.** The per-session token travels in the
  URL, never in a cookie.
* **no cookie is ever a credential.** The only cookie in the system is a
  SameSite=Strict locale preference the page stores for itself; the server
  never reads it. CSRF is defeated by the token-in-query design — a forged
  cross-site request arrives without the token and is refused — not by
  pretending cookies do not exist.
* **Host pinned to localhost**, which is what turns away DNS rebinding.
* **a strict inline-only CSP**, so nothing on the page can fetch or exfiltrate.
* **the write surface is an explicit POST allowlist**, not one narrow path.
  What began as `/api/say` alone has grown to two dozen actions, and several
  are consequential: they commit to git, delete projects and their
  directories, write Keychain items, launch remote compute. The honest claim
  is therefore not "there is nothing to reach" but "nothing is reachable by
  accident": a POST to any path outside the allowlist in `do_POST` is refused,
  every listed action sits behind the same token-and-Host gate, and none of
  them can cause anything the CLI could not already do. `/api/say` still
  treats the explicit Send action as attachment-transfer authorization, with
  large files arriving through bounded `/api/upload` transport chunks; both
  feed the same build loop the CLI uses.
* **keys are reported present or absent, never rendered.**
* **idle shutdown**, so a forgotten port closes itself.
