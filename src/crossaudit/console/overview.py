"""The numbers on the dashboard, every one of them derived from the ledger.

A supervision dashboard is the last place a figure should be invented. Each
metric here is computed from committed reports, receipts and controller state,
and where the ledger cannot answer, the answer is absent rather than zero:
"0 escalations" and "we have never looked" are different claims, and only one of
them is safe to show in a large font.

The shape follows what a person actually asks, in order: how much came through,
how much passed, what is stuck, where is the current increment in the loop, and
what is waiting on me.
