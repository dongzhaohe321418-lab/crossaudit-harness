"""Threads: the durable identity of a conversation inside one project.

Projects are real user-selected folders and Git repositories.  A **Thread** is a
lightweight conversation inside one project; it does not duplicate the working
tree or weaken the single audit ledger.  A thread's durable anchor is the
``CrossAudit-Chat`` commit trailer that ties work and audit evidence to it; this
file adds only the navigation metadata that trailer cannot carry (title, pin,
archive state, timestamps) plus a private tombstone list.  Conversation content
remains reconstructable from committed routing, work and audit evidence.

The three sources that together give a thread its identity — the navigation
record here, the immutable Git trailer, and the tombstone — are reconciled in
exactly one place (:func:`_resolve`), and every lifecycle operation (create,
rename, pin, archive/unarchive, duplicate, soft-delete) is a method on this
service.  Deleting a thread records a tombstone; it never rewrites history.
