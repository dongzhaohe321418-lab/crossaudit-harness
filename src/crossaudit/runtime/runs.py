#:   verified worker;
#: * a dead pid, or a live pid whose identity no longer matches (the pid was
#:   recycled by a stranger), is reclaimed immediately — that worker
#:   provably cannot return;
#: * an owner with no verifiable identity (schema-v1 rows, foreign-pid rows,
#:   Windows) is reclaimed once its lease expires: it cannot be proven
#:   alive, and an unverifiable owner must not hold the run slot forever.

#: Resilience-layer failure categories that mean "no configured provider can

#: rounds: routes_exhausted / circuit_open are infrastructure outages, and

        A durable cancellation request remains authoritative if the worker dies
        before observing it. Other active work becomes an explicit interruption.

        Recovery authority is the owner's *identity*, never a clock:

        * a live pid whose recorded identity token still matches is NEVER
          reclaimed — a provably-living owner's silence is narrated by the
          stall notes, not converted into a fabricated death. A laptop that
          slept for an hour mid provider call, or a foreground build under
          SIGSTOP, resumes into an intact journal, and a wall clock jump
          cannot kill a verified worker;
        * a dead pid, a reaped-later zombie, or a live pid whose token no
          longer matches (the pid was recycled by a stranger) is reclaimed —
          that worker provably cannot return. A recycle is proven by two
          *comparable* tokens disagreeing, so it never fires on a token from
          an older format;
        * an owner with no verifiable identity — no token, a pre-fix
          (locale-poisoned) token, or a probe that will not answer — is
          reclaimed only once its lease has expired: it cannot be proven
          alive, but neither may it be declared dead, so it gets one lease
          period of grace during which a live owner refreshes its token.

        The single exception to identity authority is CANCELLING: the user has
        already asked to abandon that run, so a worker (even a verified-alive or
        own-process one) that wedges and stops heartbeating for the stall grace
        window has its cancellation force-completed rather than pinning the run
        (and the single-run guard) forever. This applies to CANCELLING alone;
        every other ACTIVE state keeps the "never reclaim a verified-alive
        worker" invariant.

        The identity marker is read from the operating system, so this walks
        two phases: it snapshots the rows, then probes and (if needed) waits
        WITHOUT holding the write lock, and only then applies the reclaims —
        re-reading each row so a worker that heartbeat while we probed is left
        alone. Only this process's own runs are exempt. The interruption
        detail states only what is known — never "the process ended" when the
        owner merely could not be verified.

        The journal is explicitly operational, never evidence (see the module
        docstring): git commits, receipts and the audit ledger are the audit
        record, and this database only narrates run liveness for the UI. So it
        is safe to prune finished runs — but only the ones nothing living or
        reconciling still needs. A row is deleted iff ALL hold:

        * its state is TERMINAL — never an active run, and never a parked
          (PROVIDER_UNAVAILABLE) run, both of which are non-terminal and are
          therefore left entirely alone;
        * it finished before the retention horizon (``keep_days`` ago); and
        * it is NOT among the most-recent ``keep_recent`` runs.

        ``keep_recent`` is chosen by the caller to be at least the reconciler's
        ``RECONCILE_SCAN_LIMIT``, so the entire window ``reconcile_human_wait``
        scans (``recent(RECONCILE_SCAN_LIMIT)``) and the single ``latest()`` row
        always survive. Reconciliation only ever references runs inside that
        recent window; anything this sweep can reach is already invisible to it,
        so a referenced row is never removed. The whole delete runs in one
        ``BEGIN IMMEDIATE`` transaction (mirroring ``recover_abandoned``): a
        crash mid-sweep either keeps every row or commits the complete prune —
        it can never tear a run from its events. ``run_events`` for a victim are
        deleted before the run so the foreign key is respected.

        The optional ``PRAGMA wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)`` + ``VACUUM`` after a
        non-empty prune is pure space reclamation: it runs only after the delete
        has committed and is best-effort, so a transient lock cannot turn a
        successful prune into a raised error.
