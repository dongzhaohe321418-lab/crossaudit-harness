"""The single command path for starting and controlling an agent run.

The CLI and local UI used to share the inner ``run_loop`` but duplicated the
operational shell around it: workspace leasing, journal creation, event
delivery, exception classification and terminal-state recording.  That was
two lifecycle implementations even though both eventually called the same
model loop.

``RunCommandService`` owns that shell.  It stores no authoritative state in
memory: the SQLite journal is the command boundary and the read model.  A
background thread is only an executor; killing it leaves a recoverable journal
row rather than erasing the task.
