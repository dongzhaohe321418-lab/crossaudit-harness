#: A generous-but-finite ceiling for the document types ``blob_limit`` leaves
#: uncapped (.pdf/.docx). Their container is hashed whole, so no product quota
#: is imposed on real documents — but a pathological blob (a gigabyte committed
#: under a .pdf name) must never be buffered in full. Anything at or below this
#: bound is returned byte-for-byte exactly as before, so every normal document
#: hashes identically; only a blob past it is refused. Overridable via
#: ``CROSSAUDIT_MAX_DOC_BYTES`` for a deployment that genuinely audits larger
#: documents. It MUST match between the audit host and the verify host, exactly
#: as ``blob_limit``'s caps must: a boundary that differed across the two would
#: let one side read a document the other recorded as too-large. 64 MiB sits far
#: above real-world .docx/.pdf sizes.
MAX_DOC_BYTES = 64 * 1024 * 1024

#: The deterministic stand-in ``read_blob`` returns for a document blob past the
#: guard, instead of allocating the whole thing. Both the audit path and
#: ``receipt/verify.py`` go through the SAME ``read_blob`` and so hash THIS exact
#: constant for an oversize document — audit and verify agree byte-for-byte that
#: the document was too large rather than one of them OOMing. It leads with a
#: non-UTF-8 byte (``\xff`` can never start a UTF-8 sequence) so the prompt
#: renderer routes it through document extraction (which reports "document too
#: large to audit") exactly as it does for a real binary, and it is far too
#: specific to collide with any genuine sub-guard document.

#: holds beyond its cap is one of these chunks, not the blob's full size.
_BLOB_READ_CHUNK = 1 << 20

#: Every build round drives commit + rev-parse through ``git()``, so an
#: unbounded git is a hang that pins the run in an ACTIVE state forever and the
#: single-run guard then locks out the whole project. A stale ``.git/index.lock``,
#: a blocking hook, a credential/GPG prompt, or an NFS/fsevents stall are the
#: usual culprits. The bound is deliberately generous — a legitimate large-tree
#: commit must never be cut short — and overridable via ``CROSSAUDIT_GIT_TIMEOUT``
#: (seconds) for unusually large repositories. Mirrors how mcp.py, hpc.py and
#: codex_subscription.py already bound their subprocesses.
GIT_TIMEOUT_S = 240.0

#: How git's output is decoded. Two things go wrong with a bare ``text=True``:
#:
#:  * git emits the CONTENT of files. ``git diff --cached`` over a staged PDF
#:    prints bytes that are not UTF-8 at all, and the strict default raised
#:    ``UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0x93`` out of
#:    ``subprocess`` itself — a crash, not a denial, in the middle of a build.
#:  * Windows would decode through the console code page rather than UTF-8, so
#:    a path or a commit message with a non-ASCII character came back mojibake.
#:
#: Replacement characters are right here: every caller reads git's output as
#: text to scan or to show, never to reproduce a file byte-for-byte.
