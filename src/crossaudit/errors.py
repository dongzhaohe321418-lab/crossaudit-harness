"""Denials and exit codes.

Exit codes are part of the CLI contract (installer-design 05a): a caller
scripting the loop must be able to tell *why* it was refused without parsing
prose. Anything unexpected still denies — fail-closed is the default, not a
mode (constraint 3).

A refusal also names *what the person can do about it*, and that has to be
machine-readable for the same reason the exit code is: the desktop surfaces
route on the remedy, and they must not do so by grepping the prose. The
canonical set lives in :class:`RemediationAction` (North Star §14/§15), and a
:class:`Denial` carries an ordered ``remediations`` list, primary first. This
is the same axis slice one introduced for a parked run's ``waiting_reason``
kind — one vocabulary, so a stopped-mid-loop wait and a hard denial describe
their exits in the same words.
