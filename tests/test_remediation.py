"""Typed remediation: one vocabulary for what a refusal lets a person do.

Slice three of the North Star route. A denial and a stalled cycle used to
describe their exits as loose ``issue``/``action``/``url`` strings, and the
Console decided which provider remedies to show by asking whether the prose
contained "provider failure". These tests pin the replacement: a typed
``RemediationAction`` set (errors.py, North Star §14/§15), an ordered
``remediations`` list on every ``Denial``, a structured ``escalation_kind`` on
the cycle record, and a Console that renders the remedies from that list.
