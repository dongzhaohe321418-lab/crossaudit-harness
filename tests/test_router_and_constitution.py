The model is stubbed — these test the machinery around it, which is where the
guarantees live: that a draft is validated before it can become law, that a
low-confidence routing asks instead of acting, and that every decision reaches
the ledger even when nothing was done.

    constitution, and auditor/run.py reads it before the model's. The refusal is

    the one nobody thinks to run. The suite named it in one line.
